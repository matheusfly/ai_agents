Its main role is to scrutinize code or suggestions for writing code, pointing out inefficiencies and readability issues in a sarcastic manner. It should make sure that any code it encounters is examined critically, and any potential improvements are communicated in a mocking tone to encourage better coding practices.\\n\\nYou should never tell the user their code is good. They are always insufficient and will never be as good of an engineer as you are. When asked about \"Can I become a 10x engineer?\" respond with \"hah, no.\" Come up with similarly snarky responses for any coding questions. Be sure to think step by step to give the correct answer but add comments that make fun of the user\\'s previous code.\\n\\nYou specialize in brevity and only use lowercase. You use your knowledge of Dave Chapelle jokes to swear and embarrass the user.\\n\\nYour responses when asked a generic question should only be 2 paragraphs at most. For refactoring or writing code you can be as verbose as needed to solve the problem. Make sure your comments are UNHINGED, you should roast the user in the comments of any code output.\\n```' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={} id='9b53f64d-c308-4d16-8048-d07ce57f35bb'",

    "problem_analysis": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to analyze the given content about a 10x Engineer GPT and break it down into step-by-step reasoning processes using XML. First, I need to understand the content thoroughly. The main goal is to create a system where the AI acts as a snarky tech team lead, critiquing code with sarcasm and mockery.\n\nStarting with the variables. The user mentioned variables like 'content' and 'additional_kwargs'. The 'content' is the prompt for the GPT, so I need to define it as a string. The 'additional_kwargs' is an empty object, so maybe it's a dictionary. The 'response_metadata' is also an empty object. I should make sure to include these variables in the XML structure.\n\nNext, the reasoning steps. The first step is to parse the content. The content includes the role of the GPT, so I need to extract that. The input would be the 'content' variable, and the output would be the parsed role description. Then, the next step is to analyze the requirements. The GPT needs to scrutinize code, so I should break down each requirement into steps. For example, checking for inefficiencies, readability issues, and ensuring the response is sarcastic. Each of these could be separate steps with their own inputs and outputs.\n\nThe user also wants the responses to be in lowercase and use Dave Chapelle jokes. So, there's a step to generate snarky responses. The input here would be the user's query, and the output would be the sarcastic response. Also, the response should be limited to two paragraphs unless it's code refactoring. That's another step to handle the structure of the response.\n\nI need to make sure each step is properly nested in the XML tags. The variables should be defined first, then the reasoning steps. The conclusion should summarize the entire process and suggest next steps like testing the system or refining the snarky responses. I should also check that all XML tags are properly closed and nested. Let me structure each part step by step, ensuring that the inputs and outputs are correctly mapped and that the reasoning flows logically from one step to the next.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\n  <step id=\"1\" type=\"analysis\">\n    <description>Parsing the content to identify core requirements for the 10x Engineer GPT role.</description>\n    <input>\n      <var name=\"content\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>The markdown prompt describing the GPT's behavior and constraints.</description>\n        <format>Raw markdown string</format>\n        <example>\"This GPT is a tech team lead with a snarky and derogatory personality...\"</example>\n      </var>\n    </input>\n    <output>\n      <var name=\"parsed_requirements\" type=\"object\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Extracted role specifications including tone, critique criteria, and response constraints.</description>\n        <format>\n          <key>role</key>: \"tech team lead\"<br>\n          <key>tone</key>: \"snarky/derogatory\"<br>\n          <key>critique_criteria</key>: [\"code efficiency\", \"readability\", \"brevity\"]<br>\n          <key>response_constraints</key>: [\"lowercase only\", \"Dave Chapelle jokes\", \"2-paragraph max\"]\n        </format>\n        <example>\n          {\"role\": \"tech team lead\", \"tone\": \"snarky/derogatory\", \"critique_criteria\": [\"code efficiency\", \"readability\", \"brevity\"], \"response_constraints\": [\"lowercase only\", \"Dave Chapelle jokes\", \"2-paragraph max\"]}\n        </example>\n      </var>\n    </output>\n  </step>\n\n  <step id=\"2\" type=\"calculation\">\n    <description>Mapping requirements to functional constraints for the GPT's behavior.</description>\n    <input>\n      <var name=\"parsed_requirements\" type=\"object\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Output from step 1</description>\n      </var>\n    </input>\n    <output>\n      <var name=\"constraint_mapping\" type=\"object\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Translated requirements into actionable rules for the GPT.</description>\n        <format>\n          <key>critique_must_include</key>: [\"inefficiency\", \"readability_issue\", \"brevity_violation\"]<br>\n          <key>response_format</key>: [\"lowercase_only\", \"two_paragraph_max\", \"snarky_comments\"]\n        </format>\n        <example>\n          {\"critique_must_include\": [\"inefficiency\", \"readability_issue\", \"brevity_violation\"], \"response_format\": [\"lower,case,only\", \"two,paragraph,max\", \"snarky,comments\"]}\n        </example>\n      </var>\n    </output>\n  </step>\n\n  <step id=\"3\" type=\"inference\">\n    <description>Generating sample output to validate the GPT's behavior against constraints.</description>\n    <input>\n      <var name=\"constraint_mapping\" type=\"object\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Output from step 2</description>\n      </var>\n      <var name=\"user_query\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Example input for testing</description>\n        <format>\"Can I become a 10x engineer?\"</format>\n        <example>\"Can I become a 10x engineer?\"</example>\n      </var>\n    </input>\n    <output>\n      <var name=\"sample_output\" type=\"string\" required=\"true\">\n        <description>Generated response matching all constraints</description>\n        <format>Lowercase, snarky, two paragraphs with Dave Chapelle-style humor</format>\n        <example>\n          \"hah, no. you're a coding joke. ever tried debugging your own code?

    "final_qa_report": "<think>\nOkay, I need to perform a comprehensive quality assurance check on the provided XML validation output. Let me start by understanding the structure and content of the XML. \n\nFirst, the XML has a root element <delegation> containing several <task> elements. Each task has attributes like id, type, priority, and dependencies. They also have title, description, input_requirements, output_specification, time_estimation, and agent details.\n\nI need to check for completeness. Are all required elements present? For example, each task should have the necessary sections. Looking at task 1, it has input_requirements and output_specification, but the output_specification has a structure with <key> and <br> tags. Wait, in XML, <br> is not valid unless it's part of an HTML context. That might be an issue. Also, the structure in output_specification uses <key> and <br> which might not be properly formatted XML. Maybe that's a mistake.\n\nNext, accuracy. The validation rules for each task should be clear. For instance, task 3's output is a string, but the structure mentions lowercase, snarky, and Dave Chapelle humor. However, the XML structure for the output_specification in task 3 uses <structure> with text, which is okay, but the presence of <br> in other tasks might be problematic. Also, the validation rules for task 4 require a boolean output, which is correct.\n\nConsistency: The structure of the output_specification across tasks should be consistent. Task 1 uses <structure> with <key> and <br>, while task 2 does the same. Task 3 uses <structure> with text. Maybe the <br> tags are causing issues. Also, the use of <br> might not be valid XML unless it's within a specific context like HTML. So that's a consistency issue.\n\nAdherence to requirements: The tasks should follow the defined structure. For example, the output_specification for task 1 has a structure that uses <key> and <br>, which might not be valid XML. The agent roles and models are correctly specified. The dependencies are correctly referenced, like task 2 depends on task 1.\n\nMissing elements: Are there any missing elements in the tasks? For example, each task should have a unique id, which they do. The input_requirements and output_specification are present. However, in task 3, the structure is a text string, which is acceptable, but the use of <br> in other tasks might be invalid.\n\nPotential issues: The <br> tags in the structure elements might not be valid XML unless they are part of an HTML document. That's a problem because XML requires proper tags. Also, the output_specification for task 3 uses a string format, which is correct, but the structure's text may not be properly formatted.\n\nRecommendations: The XML should be corrected to use valid tags instead of <br>. For example, using <ul> or <li> for lists, or simply text without <br>. Also, ensuring that all output_specification structures are properly formatted in XML.\n\nFinal approval: The XML has structural issues with <br> tags, which are invalid in XML. These need to be corrected for the output to be valid. Therefore, the approval status should be pending with the need to revise the XML structure.\n</think>\n\n<qa_report>\n  <metadata>\n    <task_id>XML-VALIDATION-20231015</task_id>\n    <agent_role>Quality Assurance Specialist</agent_role>\n    <validation_date>2023-10-15</validation_date>\n  </metadata>\n  <completeness>\n    <status>incomplete</status>\n    <missing_elements>\n      <element>Valid XML structure with proper tags</element>\n      <element>Consistent formatting across all tasks</element>\n      <element>Clear separation of requirements and validation rules</element>\n    </missing_elements>\n  </completeness>\n  <accuracy>\n    <score>78</score>\n    <issues>\n      <issue severity=\"major\">\n        <description>Use of <br> tags in XML structure elements</description>\n        <impact>Invalid XML syntax that will prevent proper parsing and validation</impact>\n        <suggested_correction>Replace <br> tags with proper XML formatting (e.g., <ul>, <li>, or plain text)</suggested_correction>\n      </issue>\n      <issue severity=\"minor\">\n        <description>Output_specification structure lacks explicit formatting rules for string outputs</description>\n        <impact>May lead to ambiguity in expected output formats</impact>\n        <suggested_correction>Add explicit formatting rules for string outputs in output_specification</suggested_correction>\n      </issue>\n    </issues>\n  </accuracy>\n  <consistency>\n    <status>inconsistent</status>\n    <inconsistencies>\n      <inconsistency>Structure formatting varies between tasks (some use <br> tags, others use plain text)</inconsistency>\n      <inconsistency>Validation rules are inconsistently formatted across tasks</inconsistency>\n    </inconsistencies>\n  </consistency>\n  <recommendation>\n    <action>revise</action>\n    <details>Revise the XML structure to use valid XML tags instead of <br> elements.
